                 <p>I really admire Abel Tesfaye, also known as The Weeknd. It’s very inspirational to see another Habesha start from nothing in another country and succeed like that. He has an amazing voice, and  I love that he adds Aster Awake’s songs into his songs and even does Eskista on stage (which is a Habesha dance). </p>
